**EasyFlow-L®**
Open-Source Automated Methadone Dispensing & Patient Management Platform
EasyFlow-L® is a secure, license-free, open-source digital health platform designed to automate methadone dispensing through direct integration with dispensing pump hardware using a custom RESTful API.
Originally developed under the LVCT Health–led USAID Stawisha Pwani Project, EasyFlow-L replaces costly proprietary software and database licenses with a locally owned, scalable, and sustainable solution for Methadone Assisted Therapy (MAT) programs.

**Key Features**

🔗 **Automated Pump Integration**
Secure RESTful API enabling real-time communication between the system and MasterFlex® dispensing pumps.

**🔐 Safety & Compliance First**
Role-based access control, dispensing verification, audit trails, and fail-safe mechanisms for controlled substances.

**📊 Comprehensive Patient Management**
Supports dosing schedules, dispensing records, reporting, and traceability.

**📉 Cost-Saving & License-Free**
Eliminates proprietary pump software and SQL Server dependencies, saving up to KES 1.9M annually across facilities.

**🧩 Modular & Scalable Architecture**
Easily customizable for additional clinics, counties, or national scale-up.

**🌍 Open-Source & Locally Owned**
Built using open standards (PHP/MySQL) and free community server environments (XAMPP/WAMP).
